That’s a quantum-mechanical phenomenon, as it turns out: as temperature increases, more kinds (“modes”) of vibrational motion become thermally accessible. In practice, this means if you make a graph of $U$ as a function of $T$, for atoms (like He) you can expect a straight line, but for molecules (like fluorine gas, $F_2$) you can expect some curvature! \n","\n","<p>An experimentally-derived example of U as a function of T for $F_2$ gas is shown in Fig. 1.

When two gas molecules approach one another from a distance, their first interaction is a mutual attraction. When they get too close, however, they push apart.
