We have estimated the energy needed to effect the seasonal melting of Arctic sea ice. In this CGI, we will refine this idea a little. Specifically, we'll be exploring what difference it makes that the ice is forming from seawater, and is in equilibrium with it. Both are definite, measureable effects that could potentially impact climate predictions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"St3zJuy_T4Qo"},"source":["## Pre-class Question 1: Enter answer on CAMINO\n","\n","1.

What difference does that make? One difference is that ice freezes at a lower temperature when it is exposed to salty water (this is why salt is sometimes applied to icy roads). Another difference is that the reduction in freezing point will cause a slight change in the enthalpy of melting, $\\Delta H_{fus}$. We'll discuss the theory behind these two effects next."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YUbYJ1fFT4Qp"},"source":["_Raoult's Law_  \n","To get at freezing point depression, it is useful to think about _Raoult's Law_.

The moles of solute equals the molarity of the salt (since we're assuming 1 liter of solution) times what is called the _van't Hoff_ factor, usually designated as $i$. The van't Hoff factor takes into account the fact when some solutes dissolve, multiple particles enter the solution. Thus $i=1$ if the solute is sucrose, but $i=2$ if the solute is NaCl, etc. \n","\n","To find the new freezing point of ice with salty water, one could make a graph of $P_{liq/vap}$ as obtained by Raoult's formula, and note where this new line intersects $P_{ice/vap}^*$.
